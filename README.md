# A list of packages that don't yet exist, but definitely should

## Rationale

Today (2017-06-04) I'm at the UseR conference in Brussels, and I see a lot of useful packages and workflows.

However, there is not just useful packages. In here I would like to create a list of packages that should exist, but don't.

Want to contribute? Modify the readme on github and send a pull request. 
Or send me a message on twitter at [@rmhoge](https://twitter.com/RMHoge)
Preferably in the following way: dash (-) name of the package colon(:) explanation in a few lines.

## Example

- elevatoR; a package that controls elevators [I stole this from [chapter 40 of A Dr. Primestein Adventureâ„¢ The Day the Priming Stopped.](http://www.psi-chology.com/the-day-the-priming-stopped/) ]

# list of packages that should exist, but don't.

- TastR: create balanced food or drinks tasting experiments for party or serious study.
- witchcraft / bewitcher: -
- stereotypR : classifies people by their stance. 
- powRballad: solves the ancient problem of; what song do i choose for Kareoke, based on R-level and Nationality.
- bilocation: enables you to be at two places at the same time. [from Jenine K Harris twitter](https://twitter.com/jenineharris/status/882875745399427072)
